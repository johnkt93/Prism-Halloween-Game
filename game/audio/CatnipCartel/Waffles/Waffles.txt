"Waffles" "So we've finally caught the sewer rat sneaking around our base."
"I looked up to see a younger looking man on the second floor railing."
"He leapt over the edge and landed on his feet."
"Waffles" "We don't take kindly to those who jeopardize our operations."
s "Look, I have no idea what you guys are doing here. I just need
that key and I'll be on my way, and out of your hair."
"Waffles" "A likely story!"
"Waffles" "But unfortunately for you, that key is for Boss. And
Boss has given the order to deal with you."
s "Wait! But this is supposed to be a family-friendly game."
"Waffles" "I was only going to challenge you to an arm-wrestling
contest. I don't think Boss would approve of anything violent."
s "Well then prepared to get your butt whooped!"
"Waffles" "Great!"
"He pounded his fist into an open palm, and tossed his neck making
a loud cracking sound reverberate in the otherwise empty room"
"Waffles" "Then let's get started."
"Waffles" "But first {w} could you help me get to the table? I
hurt my legs jumping down here."

"Gabut" "Don't look at me, blame Waffles."
n "Who's Waffles?"
"Waffles" "Boss... I'm Waffles"
n "Oh! Pfannkuchen! Why'd you change your name? Trying to sound tough?"
"Waffles" "I'M NOT A PANCAKE!"
