"Gabut" "Hey! Don't touch that."
"A voice yelled at me"
"Gabut" "Boss will get angry with you if you mess with the storage."
"Gabut" "Wait. I haven't seen you around before. You new here?"
s "Uhh, you could say that."
"Gabut" "Hmm."
"He looked me up and down."
"Gabut" "Aren't you kinda small to be doing work in the warehouse?"
s "I'm just looking around. You know anything about the
key for the control room."
"Gabut" "Now that you mention it, I think I heard talk 
about that in the mess hall. Go check in with our second in command
then and he'll assign you to somewhere more, uhhh, fitting."


"Gabut" "Don't look at me, blame Waffles."
