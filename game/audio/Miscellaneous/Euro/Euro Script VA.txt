Shiki: -panting- I think we've lost them.
Cap: (Neutral)Oh, hello girls.
Shiki: Hi Cap.
Cap: (slight concern)What's wrong, looks like you're being haunted by ghosts.
Shiki: Something like that.
Cap: (quizzical) I see, I see. How are you enjoying the festival? (Jovial+levity) Enough thrills for you all?
Shiki: Enough thrills for a lifetime, honestly.
Cap: (quizzical) Where's the other girls? I thought you all decided to go out together tonight?
Shiki: Did we?
Cap: (Intrigued)Yes. Aoi, Iku, Meno, Rita, Luto, and you girls seemed all excited for tonight since it was one of the few times where you all could spend time together.
Shiki: Ah, shit. Here we go again.
